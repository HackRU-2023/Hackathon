## About

We are a group of five friends from Braude, partnered with **Nice** - a leading global enterprise software provider, to develop a web application as a part of a hackathon held at Reichman University. The project was a great blend of fun and learning, resulting in a product that we are immensely proud of.

Our application is designed to help customer service agents improve their skills. We have focused on creating dynamic simulations where agents can train their skills, especially for challenging scenarios like dealing with angry customers. These simulations mimic a voice chat between the customer and the agent, providing a realistic training platform for the agents.

Although we didn't make it to the top three, we learned a lot from the experience. Interestingly, the team that bagged the first place had a similar idea but implemented it with a slightly different approach. This only boosted our confidence as it validated our concept and encouraged us to continue refining our application.
